							<i>One cup of black coffee in the morning will be enough. Skip lunch. Have a small bowl of salad as dinner -no carbs, just lettuce and maybe several nuts. Drink green tea after each meal. Have water when you feel hungry. 1500 calories a day? No, that is A LOT. Let's try 1200 today. You are unbeatable! Now how about 800? You are still 53 kg. Make it 50 in three days. One kilogram a day, sounds possible...

							<p>My mom would take me to doctor check-ups through primary and middle school. "She is probably the shortest and the skinniest in her class" was the sentence that concluded each appointment. That was true; I was always the skinniest in the room. While this didn’t bother me, and I enjoyed the freedom of eating anything I wanted, anytime I wanted, my mom felt otherwise. I learned last year that she cried for days because one of the doctors told her that I would need the growth hormone therapy that involved injections with lab-developed HGH - the doctor was mistaken; I was just a late bloomer :) When I entered puberty, my weight and height were within the typical range for my age, and I began to notice that the meals I consumed began to have an effect on my weight.

							<p>The year 2020 was the turning point of everything. One day, I received an email from my school saying that the schools would be closed for two weeks because of this new virus called COVID-19. That two weeks became a month, three months, and eventually, two years. According to the World Health Organization, Turkey had the highest number of COVID-19 infections of any European country and the fifth highest in the world from July 25 through August 1. At first, being in our houses 24/7 seemed interesting; we had a lot of free time to do whatever we wanted. We didn’t have to stress about school because it was an unusual situation. I could have quality time with my family. But these feelings of freedom soon turned to hopelessness. Stuck at home, I watched thousands of my people die without access to necessary healthcare or education on preventing disease spread. After a few weeks, I started to realize how hard it was to survive in my house, with my three crazy and noisy younger siblings, and my parents trying to deal with all of us. The tension was increasing day by day in the house. It sometimes felt like we were filming “Keeping Up with the Tabag’s”.

							<p>I remember going to the market when it was permitted and stocking tremendous amounts of food in our kitchen. It was forbidden to leave our houses, so the best trip I could make was going downstairs to the kitchen, opening the fridge, having a little debate in my head for straight 5-minutes about what to eat, and choosing the most "unhealthy" snack. I ate what I craved - all sugar - for nearly three weeks and was constantly gaining weight. On one of my trips to our kitchen with my sister, we came across our dad - yes, the kitchen was becoming a meeting spot. While we were casually chatting, he commented on my body, which made me and my sister widen our eyes so much that the whites showed. "You should stop eating, or you will have to have a closet makeover because none of your current pants will fit you anymore." To give a quick insight, I was still underweight. This made me start seeing my weight gain when I stood in front of a mirror, and I knew my regular eating routine had to change. During the quarantine, I gained 8 kilograms, which was not healthy for my mental health. Eating was a way to cope with stress, but now it has become the source of my anxiety.

							<p>Then came the calorie calculations, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCgLoMYIyP0U56dEhEL1wXQ">Chloe Ting's</a>, constant weighing, and sometimes, not eating enough. I thought this was what people called being healthy—working out, eating clean, and keeping track of your weight. For a year, I tried different healthy snacks, different workouts, and different calorie restriction diets. I started seeing the results; the bathroom scale said I was losing weight. 
</p>
							<p>Just when I was getting more and more determined about returning to my old body, my hair started falling out, I didn't have the energy to even get out of my bed, and the only thing I was focusing on was what I ate. People frequently commented about my size, whether complimentary or critical. When I was a kid, people commented about how they could count my ribs or how envious they were of me since I could eat whatever I wanted without gaining weight. During the pandemic, people started asking me if I had gained weight. My father would remark once a week about how my face had become chubbier or how I could not maintain control over what I ate. This would lead to an argument in which I would say that he needs to be more careful about commenting on people's weight because, although it wasn't the case for me(!), some people have eating disorders, and his comments could make people upset. According to him, he was not offensive since he was just telling facts. </p>

							<p>My weight became a measure of my self-esteem. If I lost weight, I felt better about my body. If the number on the scale went up, I hid in my big clothes. Using BMI and other standard measures, I was just above being underweight.

							<p>Right after I turned 18, I got my driver's license. The first time I actually drove in the famous Istanbul traffic but not in my calm neighborhood, it revolutionized my perspective on my body image. In Turkey, all truck drivers have bumper stickers, usually cringy and flirty pickup lines. Some examples are: 
</p>
<p>
<h4>"Yolda hızlıyım aşkta yavaş" </h4> <i> I am fast when driving, but I'm slow when it comes to love. </i>
<h4>"Şoförsün dediler, kız vermediler" </h4> <i> They told me they wouldn’t let me marry their daughter because I was a truck driver. </i> </p>

	<p>The usual truck stickers are funny but redundant. That's why this one truck with six meaningful sentences on its back caught me off guard. Six of the phrases made complete sense. I took a photo of it immediately, and that picture remained as my phone wallpaper for months. The one that struck me was "Öyle süslenip püslenip yorma kendini, gülüşün kadar güzelsin bu hayatta". The direct translation would be, "In this world, you are just as attractive as your smile, therefore don't exhaust yourself by dressing up and wearing jewelry."

							<p>You don't need a lot of make-up, a nice body, or pretty clothes; how you feel about yourself, act upon others, and the energy you spread makes you beautiful. Beauty comes from inside. After seeing this truck quote and thinking a lot about it, I became better and better each day. I started accepting what I saw in the mirror and focused more on my mental and physical well-being than on being "skinny" again. Because of my exam week, I remained in Istanbul while the rest of my family was away on vacation. I had to spend this time dealing with everything alone at home. I am blessed with wonderful friends who brought dinner to my place and kept me company while I ate it by face timing with me. When the barista at the local coffee shop saw that I was spending the entire day there studying without purchasing anything to eat, he started to offer me food. I began to make lunch and dinner plans with my friends again, and just like that, as Anne Lamott said, I healed myself "bird by bird."

								<h4>The phrase "Bird by Bird"</h4>
								<p>“His father's simple yet profound advice was to take it “bird by bird,” or one small step at a time. Lamott firmly believes that writers should start small, by thinking about discrete events in great detail, like one event from childhood.” (SparkNotes)

<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>Hi! My name is Ece Tabag. I am currently a first-year student at UC Berkeley. I enjoy writing in my diary or on my blog about my experiences in life and my ideas on a wide variety of topics. Beginning a new piece of writing is always the beginning of an exciting new experience! I think that by creating a story about ordinary occurrences or actions, one might infuse them with deeper significance, causing others to view them in an entirely new perspective.
